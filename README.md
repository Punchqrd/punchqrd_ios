# Source Code for the IOS Punchqrd Product

The project was in production for a few months before being paused and archived. With beta testers including a few local business and a variety of users, the project made a successful impact on the audience it was intended for. We had decided not to monetize the project until it gained enough traction and could be sustained through some venture round in hopes of onboarding more developers.
